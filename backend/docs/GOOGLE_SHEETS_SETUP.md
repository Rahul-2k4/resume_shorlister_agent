### 2. Enable APIs

1. Open **APIs & Services → Library**.
2. Enable both **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API**.

### 3. Create a Service Account

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials → Service account**.
3. Name it `resume-screening-bot` and assign the **Editor** role.

### 4. Download the Credentials File

1. Open the service account details → **Keys** tab.
2. Choose **Add key → Create new key → JSON**.
3. Save the file as `credentials.json`.
4. Place it in `backend/config/credentials.json`.

### 5. Share the Google Sheet

## ⚙️ Update Environment Variables

Add these keys to the root `.env` file:

```ini
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=backend/config/credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=Resume Screening Results
```

A full example `.env`:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDJDBuLKgvGHum49Ng8BB5PO313lw50r3M
GMAIL_EMAIL=rahultripathi2k4151@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=wnxuepwgsauvcjst
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=backend/config/credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=Resume Screening Results
```

```

## 🚀 Test the Integration

1. Ensure `backend/config/credentials.json` exists.
2. Run `uvicorn backend.app:app --reload`.
3. Upload a resume that should score at least 50.
4. Watch the console for `✅ Candidate data saved to Google Sheets: ...`.
5. Open the Google Sheet and confirm a new row appears.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Diagnosis | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credentials file not found | Wrong path or file missing | Verify `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE` path |
| Spreadsheet not found | Sheet name mismatch | Match `.env` name to the sheet title |
| Permission denied | Sheet not shared with service account | Share with service account email |
| API not enabled | Sheets/Drive API disabled | Enable both APIs in Google Cloud |

  • Score ≥ 50 → Send positive email + append to Google Sheet
  • Score < 50 → Send rejection email
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Keep `credentials.json` out of version control; `.gitignore` already covers it.
- Limit sharing on the spreadsheet.
- Regenerate the key if the file leaks.

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] Google Sheets and Drive APIs enabled.
- [ ] Service account JSON saved to `backend/config/`.
- [ ] Sheet shared with the service account.
- [ ] `.env` references the correct paths.
- [ ] Test upload writes to the sheet.
