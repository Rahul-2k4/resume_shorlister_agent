# 📧 Email Extraction Feature Added

## ✅ What's New

The AI agent now **automatically extracts the candidate's email address** from their resume!

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Extract Data Prompt** (Lines 130-149)

Added email extraction to the first AI prompt:

```json
{
  "name": "Exact name from resume",
  "email": "candidate's email address",  // ← NEW!
  "candidateSkills": ["list", "of", "skills"],
  "experience": "Number of years or range",
  "education": "Highest degree or education"
}
```

**New instruction added:**
> 2. Extract the email address from the resume (e.g., "john.doe@gmail.com", "candidate@example.com").

### 2. **Updated Evaluation Prompt** (Lines 185-202)

Added email to the evaluation output format:

```json
{
  "name": "Full Name of Candidate",
  "email": "candidate's email address",  // ← NEW!
  "candidateSkills": ["skills from candidate"],
  ...
}
```

### 3. **Smart Email Routing** (Lines 247-255)

Updated the email sending logic to intelligently choose the recipient:

```python
# Email recipient - send to candidate if email found, otherwise to HR
if candidate_email and candidate_email != 'Not found' and '@' in candidate_email:
    recipient_email = candidate_email  # Send to candidate
else:
    recipient_email = "rahultripathi2k4151@gmail.com"  # Send to HR if no candidate email
```

## 📋 How It Works Now

### Workflow:

1. **Upload Resume** → PDF is processed
2. **AI Extracts Data** → Including email address from resume
3. **AI Evaluates Candidate** → Scores against job requirements
4. **Smart Email Delivery**:
   - ✅ **If email found in resume** → Send to **candidate's email**
   - ❌ **If no email found** → Send to **HR** (rahultripathi2k4151@gmail.com)

### Example Resume Text:
```
John Doe
john.doe@gmail.com
Phone: +1 234-567-8900

  "candidateSkills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "SQL"],
  "experience": "3 years",
  "education": "Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science"
}
```

### Email Sent To:
- **john.doe@gmail.com** ✅ (Candidate receives their evaluation directly!)
